That’s a very common confusion; the docs are accurate but not always intuitive.

Key behaviors for str.split(delim) to keep in your spellbook:

    Delimiter in the middle: just splits as you’d expect.
        "a|b|c".split("|") -> ["a", "b", "c"]
    Delimiter at the start: leading empty string.
        "|a|b".split("|") -> ["", "a", "b"]
    Delimiter at the end: trailing empty string.
        "a|b|".split("|") -> ["a", "b", ""]
    Just the delimiter: ["", ""]
        "|".split("|") -> ["", ""]

Once you see that pattern, your delimiter logic becomes much easier to reason about.

If you’d like, I can give you a few tiny split examples to mentally check your function against.
